# Domain-Adaptation-Comparisons
 Comparisons of Various of Domain Adaptative Semantic Segmentation Algorithms in the tasks of **GTAs-to-Cityscapes** and **SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes**. It can be seen that our proposed **Crack-DA** can have better performance than the SOTAs **BA-PA** and **Pro-DA** for both the **large semantic classes** such as the bus and train and the **small semantic classes** such as the pedestrian. The results further demonstrate the effectiveness of depth and edge features in the tasks of domain adaptive semantic segmentation.
